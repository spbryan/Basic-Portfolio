                <p>My journey to a career in IT started on a less traditional path than most. I graduated with a degree
                    in History followed by a Master’s degree in Education. The job market for
                    History teachers was pretty thin at the time but the budding “dot-com boom” and looming “Y2K
                    disaster” created a high demand for IT. I accepted an associate developer position with Liberty
                    Mutual who then provided me with the necessary training</p>
                <p>I started my career enhancing the PL1 mainframe Legacy systems in anticipation of Y2K. Once the new
                    millenium arrived, however, and both world and company were still standing, I was moved to a project
                    where all systems were to be rewritten using the latest technology. This provided me with a huge
                    opportunity to work on the design and implementation of a Policy Admin system from the ground up,
                    mastering object-oriented and rules-based technologies such as C++ and Aion. As these systems rolled
                    out and evolved I grew into a role of subject matter expert and ultimately the technical owner of
                    the domain. Eventually the company moved to a web-based, service oriented architecture and so I was
                    designated as technical lead for creating the next generation of PA using Java and WebSphere.
                    Eventually these systems also exceeded their shelf-life and so I am now at the beginning of
                    refactoring to my third generation of PA, breaking down the monolith in favor of microservices and
                    taking advantage of the cloud.</p>
                <p>Through it all my family has built a very happy life in coastal New Hampshire. My wife and I have
                    three kids who are now (mostly) grown and out of the house. My son is actually in his final semester
                    at UNH earning a degree in IT. One passion I developed over the years was with martial arts which I
                    spent a number of years both studying and teaching. I also enjoy playing the guitar and often make
                    my dogs howl strumming out what I, at least, think is good music. </p>
